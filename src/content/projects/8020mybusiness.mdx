80/20 MyBusiness is one of the more interesting projects I've worked on.

This online statistical analysis tool, based on the pareto principle, provide
evidence and advice aimed towards improving business performance - all you do is
upload a spreadsheet of sales data and kick back while the algorithm crunches
the numbers.

I worked closely with LYD through prototyping, testing, building and eventually
roll out to create this first version of the product.
