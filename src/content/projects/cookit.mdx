Cookit and LYD tasked me with building a web app with an ambitious goal. They
wanted to simplify cooking and shopping, while cutting down on waste.

Cookit creates meal plans for you that minimize waste. A simple example would
be: if one recipe uses half a pack of chicken, it will attempt to use the other
half in another meal that same week.

Digging a little deeper: Cookit will also remember if you have non-perishable
items from a previous purchase, choose wisely from mutliple pack sizes (a pack
of 2 or 4 chicken breasts) and even choose between premium and budget food
options.

You then simply purchase your meal plan. Cookit will ship you the ingredients
and recipes.
