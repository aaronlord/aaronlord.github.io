Rentora is a property management and rent collection tool for landlords and
tenants.

I worked on Rentora from its inception. I helped define the business, wireframed
and designed the UI before spending almost 2 years building it - mostly solo,
but I did hire and manage a handful developers to assist with the workload at
points.

The front end is a Vue single page app, styled with Tailwind. The backend is a
Laravel application that provides data to the frontend via a RESTful API.

I built bespoke systems for messaging, file storage, property management and
rent collection (including payments and payouts via Stripe).
