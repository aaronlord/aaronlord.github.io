Laravel has some pretty sweet helper functions for generating urls/links and its
auto-json-magic makes it building APIs super easy. It's the go-to choice for
building single-page js apps for me and many others, but routing can quickly
become a bit of a pain.

This package allows you to port your routes over to JavaScript, and gives us a
bunch of very familiar helper functions to use.
