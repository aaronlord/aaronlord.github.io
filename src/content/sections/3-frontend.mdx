## I'm a frontend developer

Since the start of my career, I’ve had a special affinity with frontend frameworks. I always felt like they were the future of the web.

From the early days of Backbone to Vue 3 we have today, I’ve been writing fast, scaleable, single page applications for years.

I have an eye for detail, and that's reflected in the HTML &amp; CSS I write. It's clean, semantic, responsive and always closely matches the designs.

My main strengths regarding the frontend include:

- Server Side Rendering experience
- Fast at writing design accurate HTML &amp; CSS
- Eye for UX &amp; design
