## I'm a backend developer

Working in a lead position for most of my <CodingFor /> career, I’ve built up a good,
solid working knowledge of object-oriented PHP. Since 2012, I’ve primarily worked
with Laravel, but I have used other frameworks such as Symfony, CodeIgniter, Slim and Silex.

I follow best practices, including; compliance with the PSR-2 coding standard,
adhering to SOLID principles, leverage Dependency Injection and Service layers
patterns.

My main strengths regarding the backend include:

- Quickly understanding and suggesting business logic
- Database design and optimisation
- RESTful API design
- Project architecture

I’ll always try to use the best technology or service available for the task in hand. As such, I’ve used lots, such as: Stripe, Redis, Elasticsearch, Memcached, Docker, Mailgun, Node, Pusher and Websockets.
