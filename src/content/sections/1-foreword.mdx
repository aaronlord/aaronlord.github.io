I'm a **full stack** web developer, based in the UK.

Over the last 13 years, Iâ€™ve worked with a number of frameworks, libraries and
tools - in teams of various sizes - wearing different hats.

I write DRY, reusable, testable and decoupled code. I'm obsessed with learning
new things and able to pick up new languages, abilities, patterns, principles
and styles very quickly and easily.

I am currently enjoying building single-page applications with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
