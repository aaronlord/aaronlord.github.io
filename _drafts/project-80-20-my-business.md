It's been over a year since I've written about a project I've worked on - let's change that.

![80/20 My Business Brand](/img/blog/project-80-20-my-business/brand.jpg)

The pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule) is crazy. It states that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of the causes.

- 20% of peapods contain 80% of the peas.
- 20% of the carpet in your home sees 80% of the use.

or, more interestingly to buisnesses:

- 80% of a company's profits come from 20% of its customers
- 80% of a company's complaints come from 20% of its customers
- and many more...
