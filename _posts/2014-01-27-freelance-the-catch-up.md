This is what my desk looked like this morning:

Yipee.

### 4 Weeks ago.

I'm at home for a few days over Christmas. I started a new Job last month,
so I haven't accumulated enough holiday days to take much time off. In fact,
I've had to pay for these days off.

I'm  _enjoying_ coding again. I don't want to go back. Nobody likes their job though, right?

### 2 Weeks ago.

Fuck it. I'm definitely going freelance. Time to put the wheels in motion.

##### Sole Trader vs. Limited Company.

Deciding to work as a Sole Trader or a Limited Company is a seemingly fundamental choice.
Though you can start off as one and transition later, it involves going through a period
of paperwork hell. Better to just make the right choice now.

**Sole Trader:**

- Easier option.
- You are self employed.
- Your money is the business' money.
- More money after taxes _when making less than £15k~ per year_.
- [...][1]

**Limitied Company:**

- Harder option.
- You and the business are separate legal entities.
- The company has its own bank account.
- You take a salary and dividends.
- More money after taxes _when making more than £15k~ per year_.
- [...][1]

I registered as a **Limited Company**.

##### Registering as a LTD.

The Government actually [have an online form][2] to register a ltd. It's £15 if you
can get past the very confusing second page. I couldn't.

I went through [Wisteria Formations][3]. They're pretty good even though their registration form is
littered with optional extras. The only one I went for is the printed
"Certificate of Incorporation" because apparently it's required to set up a
business bank account. I'll get back to you on whether or not it was necessary.

Total cost of registration: **£34.59**

### Now.

This week I'm:

1. Going to see an accountant for some advice on my next steps (and to check
that what I've done so far was actually a good idea). I'm hoping they'll shed some
light on the letters I received this morning.

2. Going to the bank to set up a business bank account. At the moment I'm being paid into
one of my personal accounts, which is probably bad (since the business is a separate entity).

###### Disclaimer.

I am **not** an accountant. I'm writing this as a developer. I have absolutely
no idea what I'm doing. I'm just doing the developer thing and picking it up as
I go along. I'm destined to **fuck something up** (and then blog about it).
Take everything with a pinch of salt.
