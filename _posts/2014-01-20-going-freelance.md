It feels really odd that, in the midst of a media barrage of "omg, there are no jobs!",
I've just walked out of a well paying, safe and reliable job as a Senior Developer because
it wasn't _quite_ right for me.

Now, I'm not special or unique in making this decision. I didn't do it first, and I
won't be the last. I wouldn't even call what I'm doing daring purely because I have way
too much respect for people like [@chadtomkiss](https://twitter.com/chadtomkiss), props man.

My reasoning for going freelance **is not** for more money, it's for _time_. I going
to try and equally distribute my time between doing great work for both my clients and myself.

I love what I do, and I guess this is an attempt to keep it what way.

### It's not all fun and games, _already_.

Starting today, I'm going to blog about the grim side of freelancing; Income and taxes.

It sucks so hard that in justifying the decision to go freelance, "where will I find work?"
wasn't even at the forefront of my mind, it was "I'm definately going to get fucked by the tax-man".

I appreciate that what I write about will be somewhat unique to me and
my situation, but hopefully you'll learn from my mistakes.

Let's see what happens, eh?
