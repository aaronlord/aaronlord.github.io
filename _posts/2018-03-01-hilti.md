Hilti tasked a small team of internal developers with building Ask Hilti - an education and community portal
for their engineers.

I joined shortly after development had started, but quickly got up to speed. Before long I was working closely with
the project manager, and along side their lead developer on the more complex areas of the site.

Amongst other things, we built an on-demand video and live seminar system in Angular, with a Laravel backend.
